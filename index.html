    <div class="highlevel">
      <b>Intro:</b> The web is made up of HTML, URLS, HTTP, Web apps<br>
        - Browsers send requests via  the internet and http to servers which host the files and send them back to the browser for the user<br>

        - Just about any file can be found on the web<br>
  <br>
  </div>
    <div class="details1">
        HTML = <em>Hypertext markup lanaguage</em><br>
        - composed of: text content, markup, ref. to other docs<br>
        - plain text = plain text<br>
        - to change the text you need markup<br>
  <br>
        Markup:<br>
        Tags - tags have an opening tag and a closing tag<br>
        <em>ex:</em> < name > contents < /name > and the whole string is an <em>element</em><br>
        Bold tag = < b> content < /b><br>
        Italics = < em> content < /em><br>
        Note: If you don't close out a tag then the rest of the content on the page will be with that tag<br>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="details2">
      <b>Attributes in HTML:</b><br>
      Will look like: <em>< Tag ATTR="value">contents< /tag></em><br>
  <br>

      - <b>Anchor tag</b> - < a> < /a><br>
      - Used for making links on a webpage
      <em>example: < a href="www.kdhgfihd.com">HTML< /a></em><br>
  <br>

      -<b>Image tag</b> Image tag - < img><br> 
      - Considered a <em>void tag</em>, meaning you don't have to close it
      <em>example: < img src="imgage url" alt="text"></em><br>
  <br>

      <b>Note: You need to have alt=text in the case the image fails to load</b><br>
  <br>

      - <b>Break tag</b> - < br> - also a void tag       <br>

      - Makes text move down to the next line<br>
      - Only need to put it once right after where you want the next line to begin<br>
  <br>
      -<b>Paragraph tag</b> - < p> < /p><br>
      - Keeps content in a specified box<br>
  <br>

      <b>Note: a < br> tag is an inline and a < p> tag makes a box which you can set height and width of the box</b><br>
  <br>
</div>
<div class="elements">
      <b>Elements:</b><br>
      - Elements contain their content. You can attach styles to them via CSS<br>

      < span> < /span> are inline<br>
      < div> < /div> are block<br>
  <br>
</div>
<div class="htmldoc">
      <b>HTML DOCUMENTS: What it looks like</b><br>

      Doctype - HTML <br>

      Opening and closging tags for the whole document  < html> < /html><br>

      then <br>
      < head> which contains meta data , JS and CSS<br>
      then<br>
      < title> - has the title<br>
      then<br>
      close the head tag < /head ><br>
      then<br>
      < body> with the content and closed < /body><br>
  <br>

<h2>The Basics</h2>
 <div class="Header">
      <b>LESSON 2 - Webpages, Docs and Structure</b><br>
</div>
<div class="highlevel">
      <em>Summary</em><br>
       - HTML = structure <br>
        - CSS = style<br>
        - JS = interactive<br>
      DOM = Document Object Model. A.K.A Structure Tree. <br>
      - Everything on a web page is a box<br>
      - Think as granularly as possible when it comes to webpage design (boxception)<br>
      <em>Big Ideas</em><br>
      - Your code should be as efficient as possible <br>
      - The code will appear to be well organized and succicent and then you can drill down into elements to arrive at the plain text. <br>
  </div>
  <div class="Header">
      <b>LESSON 3 - Applying Style</b>
  </div>
  <div class="highlevel">
        <br>
          - Always think of code in the most efficent way possible
          <br>
          - In order to reduce repition we use the concept of inheritance. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance"> This article </a> is very helpful for understanding this concept
          <br>
          - In order to apply style we use CSS
          <br>
          - Which is applied by using dot class such as .description then the attribute and value. <em>example:</em> .Header {color:red}
          <br>
          - For all the attributes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"> this article is essential </a>
          - You can apply CSS in either the Head part of your HTML or you can link the CSS file within the HTML Head which is generally best practice. 
          <br>
            <b>Boxes</b>
              <br>
                - Always set box border for every element
              <br>
              <b>Bit of a Recap</b>
              <br>
              - Get structure right first
              <br>
              - Then tags
              <br>
              - Then boxes
